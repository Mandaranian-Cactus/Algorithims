AVL TREES

AVL Trees are a variation of Binary trees. Binary trees are a special type of trees. Trees are Trees

Trees
-Do not contain cycles
-Have a single node at the top called the "root node"
-Every node can be clasified as a  "parent node"
-Every parent node will have "children nodes" descending down the tree
-Nodes at the very bottom a.k.a having no children nodes are known as "leaf nodes"
-Basically the entire thing looking like a triangle

Binary Trees
-Have tree properties
-Every parent node have up to 2 children nodes
-There is a "left child node" which should be SMALLER than the parent
-There is a "right child node" which should be LARGER than the parent

AVL Trees
-Have binary tree properties
-Has a height of "logn" (anchored at the root node) where "n" is the # of nodes in the tree

-Also must satisfy the property that for any node, the difference between the left and right subtrees must be at most 1
